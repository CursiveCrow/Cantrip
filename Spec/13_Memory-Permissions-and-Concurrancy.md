# The Cursive Language Specification

**Part**: XII - Memory, Permissions, and Concurrency  
**File**: 12_Memory-Permissions-and-Concurrancy.md  
**Status:** Deferred — normative draft pending  

---

This chapter will ultimately formalize the Lexical Permission System, region semantics, and the concurrency memory model. The present file documents that the material remains unwritten. Until the text is complete, readers should treat references to Part XII as forward-looking guidance and consult the outstanding issues list (`Spec/ISSUES.md`, prefix `MP-`) for the editorial plan, including the pending filename correction to “Concurrency”.
