# 960 â€” Foreign Function Interface (Normative)

C linkage via `#[repr(C)]` and explicit declarations. Ownership and allocation
across the boundary MUST be documented; `unsafe.ptr` and `ffi.call` effects are
required. Callbacks into Cantrip MUST declare effect bounds and obey isolation
when transferring ownership. Inline assembly is reserved for a later revision.
